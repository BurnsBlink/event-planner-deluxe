  description: "This November 13th-15th 2017 at USF Verftet in Bergen, we turn back the time to before 1994, to the old mood, the old feeling, the art, the people, the bands..... This is a tribute to the birth of the Norwegian Black Metal scene, and also a trade of skills between bands and tattooers with their heart in metal. And it will only happen this once!"
